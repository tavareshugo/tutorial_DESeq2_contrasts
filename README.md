This repository contains some code explaining how to set DESeq2 contrasts using the model matrix of our design. 

This approach is general and so works for a range of experimental designs, even more complex ones.

If something doesn't look correct, please let me know ([open an issue](https://github.com/tavareshugo/tutorial_DESeq2_contrasts/issues/new)). 
I would love to learn if I've gotten something wrong!
